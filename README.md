## Flutter Hands-On Technical Test

### Objective:
Evaluate the candidate's proficiency in UI design implementation, state management using Bloc/Cubit, lazy loading (infinite scroll), API integration, and overall Flutter coding practices.

---

### Duration:
**2 hours**

---

### Instructions:
- **Internet usage** is allowed to refer to documentation only.
- **No copy-pasting** code from existing projects or external resources.
- Using ChatGPT or any other Generative AI tools is **strictly prohibited**.
- Commit your final code to a **public GitHub repository** and share the link with the invigilator.

---

### Test Components:
---

### 1) Home Screen with Infinite Scroll & API Integration

**Requirements:**
- Fetch and display dog images from:
  ```
  https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=100&page=0&order=Desc
